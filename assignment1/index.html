          Q1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h2>
        <p class="answer">
          The first thing that caught my attention was the dramatic symphonic
          background music, which instantly created an immersive mood. At the
          same time, the large opening title moved with the rhythm of the music,
          giving me a sense of performance. In addition, I noticed the “scroll
          for story” instruction, and as I scrolled, the building was revealed
          from different perspectives. It felt as if I was entering a real hall
          and exploring Gehry's architecture step by step.

        <h2>
          Q2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </h2>
        <p class="answer">
          During the first two minutes, I engaged in several actions that
          defined the interaction. I listened to the orchestral music, which set
          the mood, and then observed the animated title moving in rhythm.
          Following the description, I scrolled down to view the hall from
          multiple perspectives. I clicked on navigation elements to access
          different sections and read brief texts that explained Gehry’s
          process. Finally, I watched video clips embedded on the website. These
          actions combined sound, text, and visuals to form a layered, narrative
          experience.

          Q3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </h2>
        <p class="answer">
          The part I spent the most time on was the scrolling feature, which
          acted as this website’s main navigation tool. Through scrolling, I
          accessed perspectives of the hall, short videos, articles, and
          archival images. The design encouraged continuous exploration,
          creating a flow similar to moving through an exhibition. I found this
          section engaging because it combined multiple media formats in a
          seamless structure. The balance of sound, images, and narrative text
          made scrolling an immersive experience rather than a simple mechanical
          action.

        <h2>
          Q4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction
          with the experience?
        </h2>
        <p class="answer">
          The most common action was scrolling, which served as the main
          navigation method. Each scroll revealed new layers of content,
          including images, text and videos, presented in a continuous sequence.
          Unlike other websites that rely heavily on menus or clicks, this
          design used scrolling as a narrative device, guiding users naturally
          through the story. The repetitive action also reinforced immersion,
          echoing the rhythm of the orchestral soundtrack. This made scrolling
          not only functional but also part of the aesthetic experience, turning
          a simple action into immersive and meaningful engagement.

          Q5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h2>
        <p class="answer">
          The intended goal is to present Frank Gehry’s creative process and the
          cultural significance of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in a way that is
          both accessible and memorable. The website is not only like a static
          archive, but also tells a story through music, text, images and video.
          By blending these elements, it communicates architectural value and
          aesthetic innovation in a narrative style. The design aims to inspire
          curiosity and deepen appreciation for the cultural and architectural
          value of Gehry’s work.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="card">
        <h2>
          Q6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h2>
        <p class="answer">
          The website communicates this goal through its multimedia design. The
          orchestral soundtrack sets the mood and atmosphere, while the
          continuous scrolling reveals visuals, images, and text in designed
          layers. Short videos give more information, allowing users to
          understand Gehry’s creative thinking directly. This design simulates
          walking through an exhibition, which reinforces Gehry’s architectural
          vision. By combining sound, imagery and text, the experience makes
          Gehry’s concept accessible to a wide audience and ensures that the
          intended message is communicated clearly and effectively.

        <h2>
          Q7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time?
        </h2>
        <p class="answer">
          My impression is that the experience is designed for repeated
          interaction rather than a single visit. In one session, a visitor can
          explore the main narrative and gain an overview of Gehry’s design
          process. However, the depth of content, including collections, videos,
          and detailed information, encourages further visits. Each return
          allows users to interact with new aspects they may have missed
          previously. This design reflects the way people often revisit cultural
          spaces like museums, suggesting that the website intends to provide
          both short-term and long-term value.

        <h2>
          Q8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h2>
        <p class="answer">
          The continuous scrolling and distinct sections, including articles,
          images, and videos, make it clear that there is more to explore than
          one session allows. Each section feels like a chapter in a larger
          narrative, encouraging users to return and continue. The presence of
          collections and varied media also signals that repeated exploration is
          valuable. This structure suggests that the website is designed for
          sustained engagement over time.

        <h2>
          Q9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </h2>

        <p class="answer">
          The website uses several other media forms to shape its identity. Its
          sequential flow resembles a curated museum exhibition, where each
          section is presented to build a story. The photographs or images
          reference traditional photography as a method of documenting cultural
          events. Short documentary-style videos further connect the website to
          film traditions. Finally, the orchestral soundtrack references live
          performance, directly linking the design to the hall’s function as a
          concert place.

        <h2>
          Q10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
          should act when engaging with your research experience?
        </h2>
        <p class="answer">
          It communicates that I should behave as if I am visiting an exhibition
          or cultural performance. On this website, I am encouraged to take
          time, move carefully through the content, and focus on individual
          details. The design signals that each section deserves attention and
          that the experience works best when approached thoughtfully. In this
          way, the website encourages users to interact with each element like
          an audience member in a gallery or museum.

          Q11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
          should feel when engaging with your research experience?
        </h2>

        <p class="answer">
          The reference communicates that I should feel a sense of admiration
          and cultural respect. The orchestral soundtrack creates emotional
          intensity, while the imagery and videos evoke the feeling associated
          with architecture. Together, they create an atmosphere of wonder,
          encouraging people to appreciate this website not only as information
          but also as an artistic performance. This helps shape my interaction,
          guiding me to feel inspired, engaged and appreciative of the
          creativity behind both the architecture itself and the website’s
          design.

        <h2>
          Q12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part frustrating?
        </h2>
        <p class="answer">
          The most frustrating part is the heavy reliance on continuous
          scrolling. While it creates immersion, it can also become tiring and
          inefficient, especially when trying to locate a specific section
          quickly. Unlike traditional navigation bars that allow direct access,
          scrolling requires moving through all content sequentially. This
          repetition reduces usability during multiple visits, when efficiency
          becomes more important than immersion. Although the design creates a
          narrative flow, it sacrifices practicality, which can cause
          frustration for users.

          Q13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part satisfying?
        </h2>
        <p class="answer">
          The most satisfying part of the interaction is the harmony between the
          orchestral soundtrack and the layered visual design. As I scrolled,
          the music created a rhythm that matched the unfolding images and text,
          producing a very strong emotional impact. This alignment of sound and
          visuals gave me the sensation of being inside the hall, experiencing
          both performance and architecture at the same time. The coherence
          between different media forms made the interaction memorable and
          engaging.
